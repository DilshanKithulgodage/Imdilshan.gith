                        Whether you're trying to go low-carb or simply love cooking spaghetti squash,
                        this chicken Alfredo spaghetti squash recipe is a worthwhile weeknight chicken dinner
                        you should add to your rotation. We love stuffing spaghetti squash with countless
                        fillings, but when we're craving pasta, this is our go-to recipe. </p>

                        <h5>Roasted Pork Tenderloin</h5>
                    </a>
                    <p>A pork tenderloin is a long, thin strip of tender meat from the loin of the pig.
                        Since they’re usually on the smaller side (typically 1 to 1 1/2 pounds total),
                        they roast quickly, so you’ll want to look for two that are as close to the same
                        size as possible to guarantee.</p>
                </div>

                        <h5>Beef Stew</h5>
                    </a>
                    <p> The best cut of meat for beef stew. We prefer beef chuck for a few reasons: It’s
                        cheap, and it gets more tender the longer it cooks. Some quick-cooking cuts of meat
                        (like sirloin) would get tough after simmering for 30 to 45 minutes. The opposite is
                        true with beef chuck. If you find your beef isn't tender after 45 minutes, continue
                        simmering, adding more broth or water as needed.

                        <h5>Vegetarian Chili</h5>
                    </a>
                    <p>We love to top this chili just like we do bowls of the classic, with shredded cheddar
                        cheese, sour cream, and cilantro. That being said, you can really get creative with
                        your toppings. Swap out the cilantro for green onions, add some hot sauce for a kick
                        of heat, or give some crunch to your bowl with a handful of your favorite crackers.</p>
